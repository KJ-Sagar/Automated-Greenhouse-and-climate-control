Story

Greenhouses are temperature-controlled environments in which plants are grown. Because of self-restriction, current greenhouse plants cannot be controlled remotely and must instead be operated manually using a variety of documents. To ensure the best possible plant growth, the suggested system, including temperature, moisture, soil humidity, light intensity, and so on, must be continuously monitored and managed. This work demonstrates a management system for greenhouse facilities based on the Internet of Things (IOT). The system can detect visible conditions such as humidity, soil moisture, temperature. All environmental data is transmitted to blynk, a remotely accessible online platform, using the NodeMCU esp8266.
