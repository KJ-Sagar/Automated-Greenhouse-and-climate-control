The moisture sensor is linked to the Arduino uno via the sensor module. A LM393 Comparator IC serves as a voltage comparator in this moisture sensor module. this module allows you to activate a relay that can start a water pump when a certain threshold is reached. The pump is turned on or off by the relay, which then supplies water to the parched soil. To accomplish this, the Arduino uno must send a signal to the relay indicating whether to complete or interrupt the output circuit based on readings from the moisture sensor module.
